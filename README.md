# Welcome to Panache AI

**Our mission is to build the operating system for an intelligent web.** We are transforming static websites into dynamic, controllable platforms that understand and respond to human intentions.

> **Final Mission Statement:** Panache will be the operating system that makes every website intelligent and controllable through natural language. From static interfaces to living, obedient platforms.

## 🎯 The Vision: From "Web of Pages" to "Web of Agents"

The internet today is a collection of documents designed for human eyes. Panache is the infrastructure that makes this web **machine-readable and programmable**, creating a universal control protocol for AI agents.

Our technology allows any website to become an "agent" that can be understood and piloted by AI, turning any URL into an AI-powered application.

## 🏗️ The Panache Ecosystem: Our Core Components

Panache is not a single product, but an ecosystem of interconnected projects. Each repository in this organization plays a critical role.

### 1. **[panache-bridge](https://github.com/Panache-AI/panache-bridge)** - The Universal "Body"
A lightweight, standalone JavaScript file (`panache-bridge.js`) that can be injected into any website. It acts as the "nervous system", exposing the site's capabilities as a standardized set of controllable tools.

### 2. **[panache-pilot](https://github.com/Panache-AI/panache-pilot)** - The Central "Brain"
Our AI backend service. The Pilot is the orchestration engine that translates natural language intentions into structured, high-level business action plans. It is powered by a resilient, multi-provider AI strategy (Mistral, Groq).

### 3. **[panache-ui](https://github.com/Panache-AI/panache-ui)** - The "Cockpit" Experience
The official user interface for Panache. Built with a modern stack (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS), it provides the "Command Palette" to control the web and serves as the main showcase for our technology.

## 💡 Key Innovations

*   **Universal Compatibility:** Our "Mapper" and "Standardizer" engines can analyze any website and translate its unique structure into a universal, machine-readable vocabulary of business actions.
*   **Zero-Code Installation:** Any website can be "panachised" by simply copying and pasting a single script tag.
*   **"Wow" Experience:** We go beyond simple automation. Panache provides a "magical" user experience with real-time visual feedback, making the website feel alive and obedient.

## 📊 Project Status & Roadmap

We are currently in the **MVP development phase**. Our core engine (`Pilot`) and control layer (`Bridge`) are technically complete and have exceeded our initial performance and accuracy goals.

Our immediate focus is on two critical areas:
1.  **Building the Universal Site Analyzer (`Phase 6`):** This is the engine that will allow Panache to analyze any URL automatically.
2.  **Building the `panache-ui` (`Phase 5`):** This is the user-facing application that will bring our technology to the world.

We are building in the open. Follow the progress in our individual repositories!
